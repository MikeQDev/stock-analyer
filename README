Usage: stocks.py [history in years] [ticker file start at] [ticker file end at]

Requirements:
python 2.7
googlefinance.client 1.3 ( https://pypi.python.org/pypi/googlefinance.client )
file containing tickers ( http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/companies-by-industry.aspx?exchange=NYSE&render=download )

Process:
Read tickers in from line-delimited file `ticker` in same directory
Build HTTP request query with provided tickers, and send request to google finance API
Get response from google finance API and write to disk

Issues:
----DONE1) Large queries may take very long to return... Risky if connection is reset.
2) Conflicting exchanges
Future solutions:
----DONE1) Chunk input file into several requests of N tickers
2) Allow input file to specify stock exchange (NYSE, etc)
